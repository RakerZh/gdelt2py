<COMMENTS>Words like church/mosque get mentioned too often as locations "at the XXX church" or mentions of upcoming events, etc.  Religious titles like bishop/pastor/baptism also get mentioned too often. It looks like any articles with "religion" in them though are actual discussions of religion itself and its interplay with events, so that's our best bet.</COMMENTS>
